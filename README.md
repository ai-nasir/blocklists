# Ai-nāṣir's Blocklists

On 16 July 1945, the first of many nuclear bombs was detonated, collectively resulting in the radioactive contamination
of all steel produced worldwide thereafter. Thankfully, with nuclear testing bans and the passage of time, background
radiation levels have nearly fallen all the way back to pre-1945 readings, and we are no longer forced to scavenge
uncontaminated steel from pre-nuclear shipwrecks to make radiation-sensitive tools and medical instruments. 

Today, generative AI is insidiously contaminating something far more important: knowledge. Unlike with nuclear bombs,
there are no bans in sight, and the passage of time will not decay the vast corpus of hollow words being vomited forth
onto the internet in websites, songs, videos, and podcasts, into scientific papers and literature, and, thanks to some
particularly heinous people, even onto the pages of ink-and-paper books.

Being somewhat of an expert in low quality ~~copper~~ content myself, this project is a small, vain attempt at
stemming the tide, if only a little.


## **AI-Authored Content Blocklist**

Block websites that deceptively serve AI-generated content as human-authored. 

If they couldn't be bothered to write it, why should anyone be bothered to see it?

### Inclusion Criteria

Includes domains that have at any time published content where there is a high degree of certainty that the content is
not human-authored. 

Every entry is backed up by corroborating evidence. Given the demonstrated nature of those publishing such content,
this evidence can sadly not be shared publicly, as doing so could assist in evading detection. That said, Wikipedia
maintains a guide to [signs of AI writing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing) that has
assisted in the inclusion of several entries.

### Removal Criteria

Membership in this list is permanent unless it can be shown that the evidence is mistaken, through proof of human 
authorship, publication processes, and the like, or if the domain registration lapses for a suitable length of time.
