# Ai-nāṣir's Filter Lists

Improve your experience of the web by filtering out the slop!

Being somewhat of an expert in low quality
[~~copper~~](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complaint_tablet_to_Ea-n%C4%81%E1%B9%A3ir) _content_ myself, this project is
an attempt at stemming the tide, if only a little.

## **AI-Authored Content Blocklist**

Block websites that deceptively serve AI-generated content as human-authored. 

If they couldn't be bothered to write it, why should anyone be bothered to see it?

### Inclusion Criteria

Includes domains that have at any time published content where there is a high degree of certainty that the content is
not human-authored. 

Every entry is backed up by corroborating evidence. Unfortunately, this evidence cannot be shared publicly as doing so
could assist bad actors in evading detection. That said, Wikipedia maintains a guide to [signs of AI writing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing) that
has assisted in the inclusion of several entries.

### Removal Criteria

Membership in this list is permanent unless it can be shown that the evidence is mistaken, through proof of human 
authorship, publication processes, and the like, or if the domain registration lapses for a suitable length of time.
